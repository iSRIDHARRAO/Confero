# Confero - An aid for need
---
### We Gayathri R and Sridhar Rao K developed the following project which is powered by Tezos.
---

## Confero is a Tezos blockchain based and Artificial Intelligence enabled Fundraising Platform.

 This platform is for the ones who are in need of funds to pay for medical bills to cure Brain Tumor.
 
 Anyone can be a fundraiser on Confero if they have scanning image of Brain Tumor.
 
 >**Why scanning image of patient is needed ?**
 
 >*Because this platform is AI enabled means the image will be used to predict whether the patient really affected with brain tumor or not and it will accept/deny user's fundraising request without any human intervention*
 
### How to use  Confero?

 1.User need to connect Tezos based  wallet to Confero by opening Tezos clicking on following link [Confero](https://www.google.com)
 
 2.Create profile in order to manage their fundraisings and donations
 
 3.User can click on Start a FundRaiser to Raise fundraiser request, and user need to give the details of the patient and brain scanning image in order to be predicted and approved by the system using Machine Learning
 
 4.User can also donate funds to the ones who are in need, one can browse all fundraisers in the Confero and can do donate
 
 5.User can also see their donations and fundraisers through their profile.
 
 ### Why Blockchain based Fund Raiser?
 
 #### Traditional Fundraisers works in the following way.
 
 >User can donate and raise fundraiser by creating profile in their platform.
 
 >All transactional data will be saved on their server centrally.
 
 >All the requests are verified manually.
 
#### The following are the challenges with the traditional Fundraisers
 
 >Any attacker can access to server and manipulate data and it might leads to single point of failure and there is a chance of transactional data being manipulated.
 
 >All the data will be saved only in centralized server.
 
 >Transactional data is the most important and crucial thing to be kept secured.

#### How Confero solves the above challenges
 >Transations are done through Tezos blockchain protocol in a decentralized manner. ( Blockchain have the feature of decentralization )
 
 >By the above point we can say that transactions cannot be manipulated also there is no chance of sinple point of failue with this.( as data will be stored among Tezos nodes )

 >In Confero, system uses Machine Learning Intelligence to predict for the brain tumor through scanning image and verifies without any manual intervention.
 
 >Attackers can't manipulate data by attacking blockchain protocol.

## How we built this

 *We have created this project by using the following tools*
 
 *1.React from frontend*
 
 *2.NodeJs, Express as middleware*
 
 *3.Python to implement Machine Learning model of Brain Tumor prediction*
 
 *4.MySql as backend to store user info ( We've used RDS service from AWS )*
 
 *5.Smartpy to create Tezos smart contract in order to perform transactions like donations, withdraw*
